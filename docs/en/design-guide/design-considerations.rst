Design Considerations
*********************

Depending on the audio data format, that may be lossless, lossy or compressed, e.g. WAV, MP3 or FLAC and the quality expressed in sampling rate and bitrate, the project will require different resources: memory, storage space, input / output throughput and the processing power. The resources will also depend on the project type and features discussed in :doc:`project-design`.

This section describes capacity and performance of ESP32 system resources that should be considered when designing an audio project to meet required data format, audio quality and functionality.
